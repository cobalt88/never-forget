 ## Overall Description 

Never Forget has one purpose, to help you remember. If your like me, you cant ever seem to remember the important dates like birthdays, or peoples individual food preferences/allergies, or much of anything significant about anyone outside of a small group of close friends and mayby your significant other. And if you've ever tried finding a secure and easy way to keep track of all that information id be willing to bet it usually becomes a cumbersome mess to maintain over time. Thats what Never Forget aims to fix. Keep track of every detail you need to know about anyone you know by creating a simple profile of whatever information you need to remember. Things like you 3rd cousins birthday and mild chocolate allergy or preference for carrot cake over confetti. Never be the inconsiderate person who cant remember the name of your nieces husband ever again with Never Forget.

 ## Contribution Guidelines
 If you would like to contribute to the project, feel free to do so. Some things to keep in mind:

 1. Please use structured/formatted commit messages that adhere to the following guideline: git commit -m "{the date of the commit}" -m "{detailed description of the changes}" -m "{who is making the commit}"
 for now this is just a personal preference to keep the repository nice and tidy, eventually these guidelines will be updated to reflect whatever version nomenclature i decide to use. 

 2. Do Not open a pull request on the main branch, it will be denied. period. Start a new feature branch or open a pull request to develop so your contributions can be reviewed first. 

 3. Comment your code, since I didn't write your code i might not know right away what it does. Please keep your code clean, tidy, and well commented to make integration of features more seamless. 

 4. if you'd like to be a regular contributor reach out and ask to be a collaborator, 

 5. once this application leaves the beta release environment these rules and guidelines may be subject to change.
